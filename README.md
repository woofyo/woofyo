- 👋 Hi, I’m @woofyo
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of things! My resume is not a straight line but a squiggle, sort of.  MS in Ed Psych, retired IT pro...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to accept the 70's - years that is!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, not sure at this point.  Want to reacquaint with the 'current' computer realm
- 📫 How to reach me.  Here I suppose.
